# a_currency_converter
This was one of my very first python programs I ever wrote. So I thought why not sharing it.
The idea was to set up a very simple currency converter, that converts a specified amount of money of a home currency into a foreign currency using the realtime exchange rate.
The exchange rate is taken from rate-exchange.appspot.com.
Try it out! All you need are ISO 4217 currency codes (such as “USD”, “GBP” , or “EUR”).
All the code can be found in currency-converter.py
